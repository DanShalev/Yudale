# Yudale (2014)

This project (named 'Yudale') is intended to be used as a money exchange application between friends.

IDEA: 
It is basically a web app, meaning a website suitable for a mobile phone (and can be also accessed by a desktop PC).
Using the app requires registration, and is basically an debta management site, used by a group of friend.
One can add, delete or edit a debt. Doing so, the other user will have to respond and confirm the debt.
The app also saves a log file of previous debts.

Implementation:
This site uses PHP to handle the server side, a SQL database to save user data.
The front end is implemented by HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
The suitability for mobile phone is done using a jQury.

EXAMPLE PICTURES:
Can be found in directory "README/EXAMPLE PICTURES".
